Template / Directions for registering new pages with the StateManager:


1. Create new UI page (needs to have an initializeScene method that has 'StateManager manager' as a parameter)

2. In any eventHandlers directing to the new page, make the handle method contain these lines:

		manager.sceneStack.push(manager.sceneID);
		manager.paintScene("nameOfBtn");
		
	where "nameOfBtn" is replaced by the prefix of Btn for the button. (ex. algoVisBtn would be 'manager.paintScene("algoVis");')
	Make sure the button is the same for all buttons directing to this page as this will be the key used to paint the scene.
	
3. Repeat step 2 for any eventHandlers within the class directing to other pages (using their respective keys). 
	This will allow other scenes to painted from the new page.

4. In StateManager.java's paintScene() method, add another else if statement under the others with these lines:

		else if (sceneID.equals("nameOfBtn"))
			scene = new fullNameOfNewPage().initializeScene(this);
			
	this will allow the scene to be painted to the stage. Use the same naming convention for nameOfBtn as step 2 and use the proper file name.
	(ex. else if (sceneID.equals("algoVis")) scene = new AlgorithmVisualizerScene().initializeScene(this);
	
5. Test that your page/buttons now work properly. If they do not, uncomment the debugging tools at the bottom of StateManager.java and step through
	the process of displaying and navigating your new page to find the problem, or contact Canyon and ask for help.
